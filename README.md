Industries using machinery often struggle to keep them running smoothly. Traditional monitoring systems don't always provide timely updates, leading to inefficiencies and higher costs. 
Smart monitoring systems use modern technology to collect real-time data. In our project, we use an Arduino Uno and Bluetooth HC-05 to connect machines to a central system. It then displays the number of completed cycles on a Bluetooth terminal and alerts operators with a buzzer when action is needed. This approach helps improve machine monitoring and overall industrial efficiency.
